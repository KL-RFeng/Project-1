# Numerically-Controlled-Oscillator

The numerically controlled oscillator (NCO) is written in VHDL for the NEXYS A7 (formerly NEXYS4) FPGA development board which is designed around the Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA.

The NCO utilizes the Sine look-up table that is generated from the Xilinx Vivado IP catalogâ€™s DDS compiler. The design uses slider switches on the dev board to set the tone frequency where a different set of switches sets the volume of the sine waveform.

Please access and dowload Word doc "Theory and Implementation of NCO" for fuller description of theory.

To configure the NCO and use it you need the following dependencies:
* Xilinx Vivado       
* Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA or compatible board
* provided files
